I know i can be too irritating at times when i keep texting you daily and i make some insenstive comments but that only happens coz when we don't talk, i feel like a part of me is missing. So yeah, thanks for bearing with me and hopefully you'll never leave my side. Happy birthday to you once again. And all the best for all your future endaevours. :)</b></p>
