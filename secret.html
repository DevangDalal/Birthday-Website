                <p class="1st-para">Hey! I don’t know what all to say as I am not allowed to say many things now. Keeping the boundaries in my mind, whatever I’ve wanted to say for a long time.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="2nd-para">Well, I did not have the strength to tell you all this but by my reactions I know you’ve known it all along but I just wanted to put this all in the open. You know I feel bad by the things you say sometimes and how you just forget stuff, its mainly coz you just forget things I thought were equally important to you. But well, this isn’t to point that out but to say that I am sorry I react that way, I try to keep it under control and sleep it all out but sometimes it just gets out of my control. I’ve been working on that, idk how successful I’ve been, not much I think</p>
                <br>
                <p class="3rd-para">Anyway, you’ve put up with a lot of my bullshit and idk how to tell you how much I appreciate it. If it was someone else they would’ve probably told me to “fuck off” a long time ago. Idk if it ever crossed your mind or not, but I appreciate you for keeping up with all my bullshit. Me overreacting, me doing stuff to deliberately make you feel bad, it was all just unacceptable but you just overlooked these flaws since the time we’ve known each other. And I know I couldn’t have if somebody else did all that I do, I don’t even know how and when I became like this. But I deeply sorry for all that. I am still a work in progress, I guess. And thank you for overlooking all that, once again.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="4th-para">You’ve always been there whenever I needed you and that’s the best thing I can ask for from someone. You haven’t lost the importance you had in my life and you never will. I don’t know how important I am to you right now, but you talking to make says it all. If I ever lose my position in your life, just let me know once, okay? You’ve been the best thing that happened to me and I wanna keep it that way, I don’t wanna lose everything we have coz of my stupidity. We’ve had so many <a class="link" href="moments.html"><span>moments</span></a> to cherish in such a short time, and I just wanna point out some of them. Go see them. </p>
